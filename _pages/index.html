<div class=michael-about-box>
I'm a PhD candidate studying natural language processing with <a href=ivan-titov.org>Ivan Titov</a>. I am currently focusing on question answering over large data sources such as knowledge bases.
<br /><br />
Although formally employed by the University of Amsterdam, circumstances have conspired to have me living and working in beautiful Edinburgh.
<br /><br />
I am deeply interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and all technology that makes life easier. I also like art, literature, and good coffee.
