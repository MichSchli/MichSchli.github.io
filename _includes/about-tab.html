	     I am a lecturer at Queen Mary University of London. My research is focused on automated reasoning (by LLMs and other NLP models) over retrieved evidence, especially for fact-checking and problems with similarly complex epistemology. I am also very interested in modeling structured data sources, such as knowledge graphs, tables, or parse trees. I study technologies that improve the way we interact with information, whether that is through question answering systems that allow us to interrogate data, or fact-checking systems that help us reason about the evidential support for data.<br><br>
       
       Prior to this, was an affiliated lecturer and postdoctoral research associate at the University of Cambridge, where I worked with <a href="https://andreasvlachos.github.io/">Andreas Vlachos</a> on automated fact verification. I was also a research associate at Fitzwilliam College. I graduated in 2021 with my PhD thesis from the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://ivan-titov.org/">Ivan Titov</a> on building NLP models that incorporate structured data.<br><br>
