	     Hi there! I'm Michael, a postdoctoral research assistant working with <a href="https://andreasvlachos.github.io/">Andreas Vlachos</a> on automated fact verification at the <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge</a>. I have recently handed in my PhD thesis supervised by <a href="http://ivan-titov.org/">Ivan Titov</a> at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a>, from which I will graduate this summer. During my PhD I have also interned with Amazon Berlin, as well as with FAIR London.<br><br>
      
      My research is focused on modeling structured data sources - such as knowledge graphs, tables, or parse trees - for NLP. I am deeply interested in developing techniques that improve the way we interact with information, whether that is through question answering systems that allow us to interrogate data or fact-checking systems that help us reason about the veracity of data.<br><br>

      I have a background in computer science, software engineering, with a sprinkle of cognitive science thrown in for good measure. I have an M.Sc. degree in It & Cognition from the <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english">University of Copenhagen</a> and a B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from the <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark</a>.
